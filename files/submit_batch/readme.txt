The create_jobs_YGB.R is based on scripts generated by FÃ©licien Meunier (https://github.com/femeunier/ED2scenarios) to run ED2 flexibly with different ED2IN configurations. Launching this script will generate job scripts to submit different ED2 simulations on the UGent cluster with only selected changes as coded here. This workflow requires a working ED2 installation and a functional postprocessing script. Furthermore, the script requires two R files which are provided here (write_job.R and write_bash_submission.R). 

For this specific use case we generate ED2 runs over Yangambi DRC) for three different setups (bare ground, inventory initialized with dynamics and inventory initialized with static vegetation) and provide the option to overwrite certain parameter files (see https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2/wiki/Model-parameters-and-xml-parameter-files for more info on this), as well as provide the option to run ED-hydro. It is likely that your use case will require considerable changes to the create_jobs script but (hopefully less) to the other scripts.  

Some additional scripts (create_jobs_regrowth.R and create_jobs_oldgrowth.R) are also provided as a reference to illustrate how you can flexibly adapt these scripts according to your use case.
